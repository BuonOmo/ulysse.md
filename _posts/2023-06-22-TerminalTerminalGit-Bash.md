From time to time, an intern at GitHub (or a staff eng, who knows) tries
to update the CSS, ending up with UI failures. My favorite one is the
_TerminalTerminalGit Bash_, that even [ended up trendy on google][trend].

When you Generate a new SSH key, the github doc [helps you][ssh-keygen]
tells you to either open the terminal, or git bash depending on the OS
you are using. But if you are lucky enough, you can get every explanations
at once, ended up with _1. Open TerminalTerminalGit Bash_. And if you are
as dumb as me, you will google that, and end up on my article ❤.

If you were unlucky, paste that to your dev console in the [github doc page][ssh-keygen]:

```js
document.querySelectorAll('.platform-mac, .platform-linux, .platform-windows').
	forEach(e => e.style = '')
```
